Note that in general, it should not be necessary to call this - it will be 

called automatically when the Python object dies.<P>

Note that the Flags param is not supported - if you attempt to force-close the store 

and Python certificate objects remain alive, the program will crash as those objects are closed. 

The underlying Windows function is always called with CERT_CLOSE_STORE_CHECK_FLAG. 

This means that this function is likely to fail with CRYPT_E_PENDING_CLOSE if any such 

Python objects remain alive (in which case, this function would certainly have crashed 

the process if CERT_CLOSE_STORE_FORCE_FLAG was able to be specified)<P>
